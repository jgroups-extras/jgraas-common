= JGroups-as-a-Service

JGroups-as-a-service (JGraaS) separates a JChannel into a client stub and a server:

----
         Client                                Server

    -----------------                   --------------------
    |               |    protobuf       |                  |
    | JChannel stub |   -------->       | JChannel server  |
    |               |    TCP/IP         |                  |
    -----------------                   --------------------
----

The service runs in a server, which has a JChannel, and listens for requests from the client.

Requests are defined in protobuf and sent from the client to the server, and vice-versa. Requests are for example:

* Messages (sent/received)
* View changes (server -> client)

When a request is received by the server, it is translated from protobuf to the JGroups version that the server is
running and passed to the JChannel. For example, a message is sent down the JChannel. The response (if any) is again
translated to protobuf, and sent back to the client.

The client has a reference to a JChannel _stub_, which extends `org.jgroups.JChannel`, but forwards requests to the
server. Responses are translated from protobuf to JGroups and passed to the caller.

Client and server are typically in different processes, and may run different JGroups versions. However, they can be in
the same process, e.g. for testing, but then of course they have to run the same version of JGroups.

Because the JChannel interface is relatively stable, we don't anticipate a lot of changes to the JGroups-version
dependant code, but - of course - tests have to be run for each new JGroups release to make sure of that. There should
be a test which can be run to ensure that a new version is compatible, or not.

The advantage of separating client and server is that the server can be upgraded to a new version, while the client is
still running the old version. A client running version 1 (`v1`) could for instance be talking to *2* servers, one
running `v1`, and the other running `v2`:

                                    |---> | JChannel server  |
                                          |        V1        |
                                          --------------------
----
The client is running `v1` and talks to a server which also has `v1` (bottom right).

Next, a server running `v2` is started (top right). The location of the second server is passed to the client (a stub
which can talk to multiple servers), but not yet made active.

At the same time, all clients are switched over from talking to `v1` servers to `v2` servers. This means that all requests
are *sent* to the `v2` servers, but lingering requests from `v1` servers can still be *received*.

When we are sure that no lingering `v1` requests are present, all `v1` server can be terminated.

At this point, there are 2 options:

* The `v1` client can be restarted running `v2`, but this is still a client stub talking to a server, or
* The `v2` client and server can be terminated, and a real JChannel *embedded in the application* talking `v2` can
be started. This instance is able to talk to all `v2` servers or embedded `v2` instances.

== Infinispan
The main use will be rolling upgrades for Infinispan (but of course this can be used for standalone JGroups applications,
too). Some ideas for implementing this are:

* Methods such as `send()` etc are converted to protobuf and forwarded to the server
* Anxillary methods such as `getName()`, `getAddress()`, `getView()` etc are cached by the client stub
* Implementations of `ProbeHandler`, `AddressGenerator` etc are provided on the *server side only*. Note that we could
theoretically serialize implementations (lambdas) and send them to the server.
* `org.jgroups.Event`: we hope to avoid having to serialize events to send them from client to server, or vice versa.
Classes which use events (e.g. `UpHandler`, or fetching the local physical address via a down-event) should be converted
